## React+Redux

An example React+Redux application

Features:
- "feature first" folder structure: “plain” components exported by name, with "container" components as default export.
- Hot Module Replacement (HMR) (exchanges, adds, or removes modules while the application is running, without a full reload. This can significantly speed up development.)
- use Redux-ORM to manage relational data in the Redux store.
